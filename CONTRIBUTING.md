<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<!-- Proper indentation (2 spaces) -->
<div class="container">
  <section class="feature">
    <h2>Title</h2>
  </section>
</div>
```

### CSS
```css
/* Use BEM naming convention */
.card {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.card__title {
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.card__description {
  color: #666;
}

/* Mobile-first approach */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
// Use clear, descriptive names
function initializeMobileMenu() {
  const menuToggle = document.getElementById('menu-toggle');
  const menu = document.getElementById('menu');
  
  menuToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    menu.classList.toggle('active');
  });
}

// Add comments for complex logic
// Calculate average placement success rate
const avgPlacementRate = (rates) => {
  return rates.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / rates.length;
};
```
